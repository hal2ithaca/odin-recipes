        <h6>A creamy baked chicken dish layered with fresh spinach and melted cheese.</h6>
        <p>This recipe begins by seasoning and sautéing diced chicken until it becomes golden and cooked through. Fresh spinach is then lightly wilted to preserve its bright green color and tender texture. Both ingredients are combined in a baking dish to prepare for the final step.</p>
        <p>A generous layer of cheese is added on top before baking to create a creamy, bubbling finish. The result is a warm, comforting meal that pairs perfectly with rice, pasta, or crusty bread, making it ideal for a quick and satisfying dinner.</p>
