        <h6>A hearty dish featuring tender chicken, roasted cauliflower, and melted cheese.</h6>
        <p>The recipe starts by roasting cauliflower florets until they become slightly golden and tender. Meanwhile, the chicken is seasoned and cooked in a skillet until well-browned. Once both parts are ready, they are mixed together to form the base of the dish.</p>
        <p>To finish, shredded cheese is added on top and melted to create a rich, comforting layer. This dish is quick, nutritious, and pairs well with salads, rice, or even as a standalone low-carb meal.</p>
